# Get-Your-Drink-On
This is the final project for CS207 through the University of Regina. We will be creating the software and hardware for an Arduino Uno powered drink bot. This bot will be able to deliver pre-set amounts of "liquid" into a preplaced glass via the push of a button. Cheers!

Talk about the frame build first? 

The first thing to do is ensure the CPU of the wiring will allows power the pumps (be hella detailed about which wires went where)

The second thing to do is to connect the LEDS to the Arduin 
(insert pic) 

The Third thing to do is to connect hijack the staples button and connect it to the Arduino 
(insert pic) 

Once everything has been wired you can add all components to the frame 
(insert pic of this) 

Now its time to code!
(insert code maybe or guide user to check out the code in the code folder we made?)
