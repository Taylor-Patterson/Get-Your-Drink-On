This project used Seafox_câ€™s project schematics to connect power source to the pumps via the CPU. 
Their schematics can be found under the "schematics" section at the bottom of this website:

It is important to note that our project used a different power source. We also used different pumps and did not attach transistors to them. 
We also did not use the use the Bluetooth model HC-05.
